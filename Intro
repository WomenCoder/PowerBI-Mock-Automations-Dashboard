Hey!

Welcome to the PowerBI Dashboard for a Mock Automation Project I created.

The dasbhoard visualizes mock Automation data across:
      Countries (USA, UK, France, Italy, India etc.)
      Automation Solutions (RPA, ML, OCR, Chatbot etc.) 
      CPG Divisions (Food, Beverages, Household Products etc.)
      Teams (Business Analysts, Developers, Testers, Support)
      Technologies (BluePrism, UIPath, Automation Anywhere, TensorFlow, Azure etc.)
      
The dashboard also captures Automation Run Hours and a Blocker tracker. 

Let me know your thoughts!
